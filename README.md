# Example Code for Using the SAT Encodings of BroT

This project consists just of a single [Main][main] file with some example code for encoding propositional _atmost_ and _atleast_ constraints with the [FeatureIDE][fide] library.

Further information is given in the [BroT][brot] project and the corresponding paper [_"SAT Encodings of the At-Most-k Constraint: A Case Study on Configuring University Courses"_][paper].
